<!--
	The improvement template is used for improving existing functionality.
	If you are not sure whether this will actually be implemented, better open
	a SUGGESTION issue first, where you can discuss suggested improvements.
-->

**Location**&emsp; <!--
	Package name and improvement name.
	I.e: [wire] Serialization code -->

**Discussed in**&emsp; <!--
	Only if there exists one.
	The suggestion issue number that was used to discuss this feature or a link
	to a discussion in another issue or merge request.
	I.e: #66 -->

**Changes**&emsp; <!--
	Describe the changes to be made. Reminder:
	* What parts of the code need to be changed?
	* How is it done (high level information that is important)?
	* What are the acceptance criteria (i.e., what tests are needed)?
	  This can be ignored if it is obvious.
	I.e: Make function Xyz() take variadic arguments instead of a slice. -->

**Context**&emsp; <!--
	What are the benefits of the improvement or why is it needed?
	I.e: Xyz() is now much simpler to use and calls to it are more readable. -->

**Acceptance criteria**&emsp; <!--
	What does the reviewer need to check?
	When can the reviewer accept the PR? -->

**Suggested implementer and reviewers**&emsp; <!--
	Who should implement this?
	Who is reviewing the concept?
	Who is reviewing the implementation? -->

**Implementation hints**&emsp; <!--
	Hints on how to realize the implementation (useful if someone else has to do it). -->
